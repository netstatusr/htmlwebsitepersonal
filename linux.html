            Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel, which is
            the core of the Linux operating system. It was made by Linus
            Torvalds in 1991. During his time at the University of Helsinki, he
            developed the Linux kernel as a hobby project. Since then, it has
            been garnering a lot of attention and popularity over the years from
            various governments, companies, and individuals. It has been used in
            a wide range of applications, from desktop computers to
            supercomputers, and has become a popular choice for developers and
            system administrators. Linux is popular for servers for its
            stability, security, and flexibility. Linux is widely used in data
            centers, cloud computing, and embedded systems and is also popular
            for its community-driven development model, which encourages
            collaboration and innovation.

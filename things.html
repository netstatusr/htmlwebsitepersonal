        <p>how does Micro$oft make their money on Windows? You can download Windows for free on their website and it is even activated for personal
        use. And you may think that they are not making anything on Windows anymore, yes you can still buy it for 60$ if you want. Microsoft makes their money from Windows by telemetry
        and ads. They sell the collected data to other companies or to use it themselves. They show you adveritising while you're using Windows by injecting them into
        the Start Menu. And they don't let you disable telemetry because who cares about user privacy? (money over safety) I think privacy is a
        fundamental human right that should be respected but no.. They only care about shareholders instead of customers. (who likes billionares anyway?)
